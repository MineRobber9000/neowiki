# Penny's Pages

Penny's Pages is a neocities wiki created (and primarily written for) by OwlMan.<sup>[[1](#references)]</sup>
Originally hosted as a part of Hyperlink, Penny's Pages is hosted on [its own site](//thewikion.neocities.org).<sup>[[2](#references)]</sup>
It has a few typos and isn't really about neocities. This wiki was created because of its lack of professionality (mostly brought on by its creator) and because minerobber had nothing better to do with an afternoon.

Penny's Pages has topics on such things as:

 - [Cat porn](https://thewikion.neocities.org/wiki/cat_pr0n.html)
 - [DOOM](https://thewikion.neocities.org/wiki/captain_hawkes_doom_wads.html) [WADs](https://thewikion.neocities.org/wiki/joel_wad.html)
 - [A font from a webcomic by Penny's Pages creator OwlMan](https://thewikion.neocities.org/wiki/man_mad_font.html)
