Neocities Districts [is/was](# "currently on hiatus") a catalog of Neocities sites, divided by topics. Sites can be in up to 2 categories. For example, [mariteaux](//mariteaux.neocities.org) is in [Arcadia][] and [Silver Lake][], while [Project2](//project2.neocities.org) is in only [Silicon Valley][].

(history (paraphrase from about page if needed but don't actually do that that's bad))

Sebastian (shortened to Seb) is the Districts mascot, said to be tasked with "[sorting all of the sites on Districts](https://districts.neocities.org/about/)". He is canonically [a blue-and-yellow armadillo with black square glasses](https://districts.neocities.org/images/staff/seb.png). [An entire section of the Districts site is dedicated to Seb fanart.](https://districts.neocities.org/fanart/)

Districts has had 5 people who have ever been a part of their staff. [mariteaux](https://mariteaux.neocities.org/) is the passionate project lead of Neocities Districts, "coordinating efforts and working with the site markup" ([Districts about page](https://districts.neocities.org/about/)). His site is in the [Arcadia][] and [Silver Lake][] districts. [dotcomboom](https://dotcomboom.somnolescent.net "originally dotcomboom.neocities.org") is the site manager of districts. The districts website uses his software, AutoSite, which "helps you keep all of your website's pages in the same basic template" ([dotcomboom](https://github.com/dotcomboom/AutoSite#readme), 1). His site was in the [Silicon Valley](https://districts.neocities.org/silicon-valley "While his site remains linked, it is no longer online.") district. [lempamo](https://lempamo.neocities.org) was the miscellaneous and backup programmer of districts. He left and was kicked out of districts, and the discord server respectively due to ideological differences. Capy was an artist for Districts. Her neocities site, [gwtagacw](https://gwtagacw.neocities.org), is located in the [Arles][] and [Petsburg][] section. She has since moved on to [Somnolescent](https://capy.somnolescent.net). Cheren was the site scouter for districts. His neocities site, [bugland](https://bugland.neocities.org), is located in the [Petsburg][] section. His other site can be found [on Somnolescent](https://cheren.somnolescent.net).
